Introduction/Business Problem

A client is interested in opening a restaurant in the Melbourne CBD, however he is unsure about which type of cuisine he should offer, as
well as the location of his restaurant.
He would like to have a visual representation of how different types of restaurants are distributed in the Melbourne CBD in order
to help him to make a more informed decision about his restaurant.

Data section

The Foursquare location data will be used to solve this problem. This project will mainly use the 'explore' endpoint to obtain a general 
idea of the categories and the locations of different restaurants in the Melbourne CBD.
